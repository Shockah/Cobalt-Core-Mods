# Duo Artifacts

**THE MOD REQUIRES [Kokoro](https://github.com/Shockah/Cobalt-Core-Mods/blob/master/Kokoro).**

The mod adds a new artifact pool: duo artifacts, which are pretty powerful artifacts, synergizing between two different crew members.

You can get a total of 2 duo artifacts per run:
* The first duo is only available to get in zone 1.
* The second duo is available to get in zones 2 and 3.

To get a duo, your character first needs to be eligible for one, by fulfilling **at least one of these requirements**:
* Have any of their character-specific artifacts.
* Have any of their character-specific rare cards.
* Have at least 5 of their character-specific cards of any rarity. *Basic cards do not count as CAT cards for this requirement.*

If at least two characters in your crew are eligible for duo artifacts, you are guaranteed for the duo to be offered as one of the choices whenever you are offered an artifact reward, as long as you did not get a duo for this zone yet.
The mod also shows you if a character is eligible for duo artifacts in their tooltip.

Huge thanks to Arin from the Cobalt Core's Discord community for all the art in this mod! Without them, the mod could never be made.
Also thanks to everyone who helped brainstorm the duo artifact ideas and/or names!
