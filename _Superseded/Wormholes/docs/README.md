# Wormholes

Is that... a wormhole? Adds a pair of wormholes on each map, which lets you traverse forward or backward, with some down/upsides.

Both ways of travel give you a downside of your choice (+1 Debris card / -hull / -max shield).
Traveling forward also gives you an upside of your choice (one of the choices available when starting a run).
Revisited map nodes are empty - they have no enemies, rewards or events.
